# Scribble
Scribble is a simple drawing application. It is a demonstration of how to combine ASP.NET Blazor and Electron and create cross platform applications using .NET 5 with JavaScript interoperability.

## Development
To develop applications like Scribble, you'll first need to have npm, which can be done by [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Scribble uses [atrament.js](https://github.com/jakubfiala/atrament.js) for handling drawing on the canvas element and [Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET) to package it into an electron application.
